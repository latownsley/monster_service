Created a text-based UI that interfaces with two separate services to generate and display randomized "monster date" images. Designed and implemented:

A user interaction loop using Tkinter and console input to trigger matchmaking requests

A pseudo-random number generator service that outputs integers via a shared file

An image service that maps numbers to corresponding image file paths and displays them using PIL

Inter-process communication through text files, simulating asynchronous service messaging
Emphasized modular design and playful user feedback for an engaging, game-like experience.
